React site hosted over at `https://nealetw.com/`, serving as a portfolio for me! Hopefully you like it, and all its pretty okay code. Theres my original just portfolio thing, along with a little clicker game inside it as well. The portfolio side has both desktop and mobile in mind, the game does not.

When using this code yourself, make sure to `npm i`, then `npm start`, which should host the web server on the `3000` port.

`npm run build` will create a build inside the `/build` folder for deployment.

This was a site made using the `npx create-react-app` command initially.
